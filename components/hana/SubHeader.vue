            Due to its IMDB property, SAP HANA enables data analysts to query
            large volumes of data in real time. HANAâ€™s in-memory computing
            database infrastructure frees analysts from having to load or write
            back data. Also HANA is a columnar-based data storage system and
            therefore it is ACID compliant(atomicity, consistency, isolation and
            durability) and supports industry standards, such as structured
            query language (SQL) and multidimensional expressions (MDX). SAP
            HANA also includes a programming component that enables a developer
            to create and run customised application programs on top of HANA
