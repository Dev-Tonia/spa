HANAâ€™s in-memory computing database infrastructure frees analysts from having to load or write back data. Also HANA is a columnar-based data storage system and therefore it is ACID compliant(atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) and supports industry standards, such as structured query language (SQL) and multidimensional expressions (MDX).
SAP HANA also includes a programming component that enables a developer to create and run customised application programs on top of HANA`,
